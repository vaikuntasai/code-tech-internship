# Resources
resources = ["Labor", "Material_X", "Material_Y"]

}

# Decision variables - how many of each product to make
production = {p: pl.LpVariable(f"Produce_{p}", lowBound=0, cat='Integer') for p in products}

# Objective function: maximize profit
model += pl.lpSum([profit[p] * production[p] for p in products]), "Total_Profit"

<summary><b>Model Infeasibility</b></summary>

When your model returns as "Infeasible":

```python
# Solution 1: Implement an elastic model to find constraints causing infeasibility
